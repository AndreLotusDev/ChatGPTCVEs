## Introduction

Welcome to the CVE Extraction and Recommendation Project! This project is aimed at helping you understand and work with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) related to the .NET ecosystem. 

## CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

**CVE**, which stands for **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**, is a system for identifying, naming, and tracking vulnerabilities in software and hardware. Each CVE entry is a unique identifier for a specific vulnerability, and it includes information about the affected software, the nature of the vulnerability, and steps to mitigate or fix it. CVEs are widely used in the cybersecurity community to track and address security issues.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting and managing CVEs related to the .NET framework and ecosystem. It does the following:

1. **CVE Data Extraction**: Utilizing web scraping and data collection techniques, this project retrieves the latest CVE data related to .NET from reliable sources.

2. **Local Storage**: The extracted CVE data is stored locally using MongoDB, providing a central repository for vulnerability information.

3. **Dockerization**: The project can be easily containerized using Docker, allowing for seamless deployment and scaling.

4. **Integration with ChatGPT**: The project integrates with ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, to provide recommendations and insights based on the extracted CVE data. You can interact with ChatGPT to get information, recommendations, and guidance on addressing specific CVEs.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core**: The project is developed using .NET Core, a cross-platform framework for building modern, high-performance applications.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage CVE data locally.

- **Docker**: Docker containers are used for packaging the application, making it easy to deploy and manage.

- **ChatGPT Integration**: The project leverages the capabilities of ChatGPT for providing recommendations and information related to CVEs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have .NET Core and Docker installed on your machine.

3. **Configure MongoDB**: Set up and configure MongoDB as the local database for CVE storage.

4. **Build and Run**: Build the .NET Core application and run it within a Docker container.

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can use it to:

- Extract and update CVE data related to .NET.
- Store and manage CVE information locally.
- Interact with ChatGPT for recommendations and insights regarding specific CVEs.

Detailed usage instructions and API documentation can be found in the project's documentation.

## Integration with ChatGPT

The integration with ChatGPT allows you to have conversations with the model to get information and recommendations about CVEs. The model can provide guidance on how to address specific vulnerabilities, suggest security best practices, and answer questions related to CVEs.
